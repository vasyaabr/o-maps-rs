# O-maps
Maps for Orienteering (Rogaining) in Serbia, Overlaid on OSM Background

Created using the JavaScript library Leaflet and the project https://github.com/efradkin/o-maps.

Maps are published as low-quality JPEG files (unless the map owners have agreed otherwise). The quality is sufficient for viewing but not for printing.

The active page based on this project is available here.
